# Cross-corpus-readability-compatibility-assessment-for-English-texts

## Background
Text readability assessment has attracted the attention of international researchers and has been widely applied in various fields. However, different research groups often use the different corpus, and existing research lacks exploration of corpus compatibility. We propose a new evaluation framework for the task of cross-corpus text readability compatibility assessment(**CRCA**). The specific approach includes (1) Corpus: CEFR, CLEC, CLOTH, NES, OSP, and RACE. The linguistic features, GloVe word vector representation, and the fusion features of the two were extracted. (2) Classification model: Machine learning methods (XGBoost, SVM) and deep learning methods (BiLSTM, Attention-BiLSTM) were used; (3) Compatibility metrics: RJSD, RRNSS, and NDCG metrics. We mainly found that: (1) The compatibility of the corpora was validated, with OSP being significantly different from other commonly used datasets. (2) There is an adaptation effect between corpus, feature representation, and classification method. (3) The three metrics get similar results, which verifies the robustness of the compatibility assessment method. The results of this study provide valuable references for corpus selection, feature expression, and classification methods, and benefit research on cross-corpus transfer learning.

## Data
### Corpus
We used six datasets for readability research. The source files can be obtained from Baidu Cloud.


| Dataset | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CEFR    | The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) is an internationally recognized standard for describing language proficiency and levels. The standard divides six levels based on language texts of different difficulty levels, from beginner to professional level. |
| CLEC    | Chinese Learner English Corpus (CLEC) is a corpus based on learners' English writing. There are five levels of corpus, including middle school students, college English level 4 and 6, junior and senior professional English.                                                        |
| CLOTH   | CLOTH is a large-scale English cloze test set, which is divided into two grades: junior high school and senior high school.                                                                                                                                                            |
| NES     | Newsela (NES) corpus consists of news articles. It covers articles from grade 2 to grade 12 at different levels, allowing students to practice reading on texts appropriate to their ability level.                                                                                    |
| OSP     | The OneStopEnglish (OSP) corpus contains three levels of reading difficulty (primary, intermediate, and advanced), with 189 texts at each level.                                                                                                                                       |

## Framework
We proposed a method for cross-corpus evaluation that aims to predict the readability of text from different corpora and assess the compatibility of readability systems. The project framework contains six steps: **Feature Extraction**, **Word Vector Representation**, **Feature Fusion**, **Training Model**, **Readability Prediction** and **Readability System Compatibility Assessment**.

## Results
We conducted readability assessments on six corpora using three experimental combinations, including machine learning+features, machine learning+GloVe word vectors, deep learning+GloVe word vectors, machine learning+fusion features, and deep learning+fusion features. We used three evaluation metrics to assess the compatibility of the predicted results, and here we show the results of the RJSD evaluation, while the evaluation results of RRNSS and NDCG are detailed in the paper.
